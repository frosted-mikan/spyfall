                <p>Spyfall is a party game unlike any other, one in which 
                    you get to be a spy and try to understand what's going on 
                    around you. It's really simple! Spyfall is played over 
                    several rounds, and at the start of each round all players 
                    receive cards showing the same location — a casino, a traveling circus, 
                    a pirate ship, or even a space station — except that one player receives 
                    a card that says "Spy" instead of the location. Players then start asking 
                    each other questions — "Why are you dressed so strangely?" or "When was 
                    the last time we got a payday?" or anything else you can come up with — 
                    trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, 
                    so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better 
                    create a good story!</p>
                <p>After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends 
                    and whoever has scored the most points is victorious! This party game 
                    makes neurotic suspicions fun!</p>
