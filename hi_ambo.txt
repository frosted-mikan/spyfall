hihihi yeet

Components I think we should/could include: 
-preset and custom locations 
-toggle locations on/off (whether or not they are included) 
-custom timer (increment by minutes) 
-minimum three players (game cannot be created otherwise) 
-during game, list of locations can be crossed off 
-choose 1 or 2 spies 
-during game, list of players (as suspects for being spy) can be crossed off 
-possibly have infinite time option, and players can decide to vote whenever 
-room code is click to copy
-possibly have a built in message chat (like Avalon)? 
-during game, click to reveal your own role, like in Avalon: if you're the spy, it says "You are Spy" and if you're not, it says "You are in x location" 
-rules and/or credits page(s)

-here is ambo's addition to this text file
